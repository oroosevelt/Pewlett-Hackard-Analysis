# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
#### Using pgAdmin 4 - SQL
###### By: Omie Roosevelt

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees by their title and identify which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  


# Results

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

As a result for preparing for the "Silver Tsunami",Bobby and I were able to put a few different tables to organize the data. What we have compiled, is a list of current employees and their titles born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 and employees who are eligible for the mentorship program born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

The table below represents those employees ready for retirement and what position they hold in the company.
