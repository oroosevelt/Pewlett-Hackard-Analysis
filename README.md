# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
#### Using pgAdmin 4 - SQL
###### By: Omie Roosevelt

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees by their title and identify which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  


# Results

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

As a result, for preparing for the "Silver Tsunami‚Äù, Bobby and I were able to put a few different tables to organize the data. What we have compiled, is a list of current employees and their titles born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955 and employees who are eligible for the mentorship program born between January 1, 1965, and December 31, 1965.

The table below represents those employees ready for retirement and what position they hold in the company.

The table below represents employees born in the year 1965 that are eligible for the Mentorship Program.

Some of the major factors we should consider are:

  - Having enough employees to mentor future employees
  - Although we have many qualified employees for the Mentorship Program, discovering how many employees who are interested in participating.
  - Determine how many qualified candidates we have for future promotions
  - Determining how many employees we will need for future onboarding  
  


# Summary 
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Predicting how many employees will be retiring soon is essential for the needs of the business. Management has to have a clear path to make executive decisions. Below th table represent how many employees are in each position possibly retiring. Having a total count gives us a clear foresight of what is to come. This gives us an idea of how many possible promotons within and external onboarding is needed.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Although we have retirement-ready employees eligible for the mentorship program, I do personally feel that we do not have enough to mentor future employees. We should consider allowing employees who are qualified by their performance vs. their age to be a part of the mentorship.
